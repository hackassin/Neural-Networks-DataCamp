"""
You're now going to practice calculating slopes. When plotting the mean-squared error loss function against predictions,
the slope is 2 * x * (y-xb), or 2 * input_data * error. Note that x and b may have multiple numbers
(x is a vector for each data point, and b is a vector). In this case, the output will also be a vector,
which is exactly what you want.
You're ready to write the code to calculate this slope while using a single data point.
You'll use pre-defined weights called weights as well as data for a single point called input_data.
The actual value of the target you want to predict is stored in target.
"""

# Calculate the predictions: preds
preds = (input_data * weights).sum()

# Calculate the error: error
error = target - preds

# Calculate the slope: slope
slope = 2 * input_data * error

# Print the slope
print(slope)
